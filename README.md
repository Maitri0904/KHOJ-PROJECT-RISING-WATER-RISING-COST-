<h1>Vadodara Flood Impact Analysis</h1>

<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Data Analysis & Impact Assessment</p>
<p><strong>Focus:</strong> Financial, structural, and social impact of urban flooding</p>
<p><strong>Study Area:</strong> Vadodara City (Five most-affected areas)</p>

<hr>

<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project analyzes the financial and structural damage caused by recurring floods in Vadodara.
Using survey data from the five most-affected areas, the study quantifies economic losses,
housing damage, cleaning costs, and the disproportionate impact on different income groups.
</p>

<p>
The findings highlight that flooding is not an isolated event but a recurring disaster,
impacting the city approximately once every five years.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>🌊 Flood Severity & Duration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Average water level on roads reached <strong>4.99 feet</strong>, severely restricting transportation and emergency access.</li>
    <li>Floodwater remained inside homes for an average of <strong>59.18 hours</strong> (nearly 2.5 days).</li>
    <li>During the first 2–3 days, indoor water levels ranged between <strong>2 to 5 feet</strong>, creating dangerous living conditions.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>💰 Total Financial Impact</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Total flood damage cost:</strong> ₹ <strong>3.0 Million</strong> (surveyed areas only)</li>
    <li><strong>Building repair costs:</strong> ₹ 1.0 Million</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning-related costs:</strong> ₹ 919 Thousand</li>
</ul>

<p>
These figures reflect only surveyed households and indicate a much larger city-wide economic burden.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>🏘️ Impact by Income Group</h2>
<p>
The cost distribution across income groups shows a clear imbalance due to household representation
and vulnerability.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Lower Income Group (LIG):</strong> ₹ 0.95 Million (most affected)</li>
    <li><strong>Middle Income Group (MIG):</strong> ₹ 1.01 Million</li>
    <li><strong>Higher Income Group (HIG):</strong> Lower overall impact</li>
</ul>

<p>
Survey composition:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>140 MIG households</li>
    <li>138 LIG households</li>
    <li>83 HIG households</li>
</ul>

<h2>📍 Area-wise Damage Assessment</h2>

<h3>Manjalpur (Worst Affected Area)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Total damage cost:</strong> ₹ 1.28 Million</li>
    <li><strong>Building damage:</strong> ₹ 887.68 K</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning costs:</strong> ₹ 287.22 K</li>
</ul>

<p>
Manjalpur recorded the highest financial losses across almost all damage categories,
making it the most vulnerable area in this study.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>🏗️ Structural Repair Costs</h2>
<p><strong>Total structural repair cost:</strong> ₹ 1.40 Million</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Wall plaster & paint:</strong> ₹ 1.17 Million (largest expense)</li>
    <li><strong>Compound wall repairs:</strong> ₹ 119 K</li>
    <li><strong>Garden maintenance:</strong> ₹ 106 K</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Area Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vishwamitri:</strong> ₹ 836 K (wall plaster & paint)</li>
    <li><strong>Manjalpur:</strong> ₹ 166 K (second highest plaster & paint cost)</li>
    <li><strong>Compound wall repairs:</strong> Vishwamitri (₹ 55 K), Manjalpur (₹ 31 K)</li>
    <li><strong>Garden repairs:</strong> Aksharchowk (₹ 27.6 K), Mujmahuda (₹ 27.0 K)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>🧹 Cleaning Cost Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>Total cleaning cost:</strong> ₹ 919 K</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Water tank cleaning & removal:</strong> ₹ 476 K (largest cleaning expense)</li>
    <li><strong>Hiring cleaners:</strong> ₹ 366 K</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning materials:</strong> Remaining portion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Area-wise Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Manjalpur:</strong> ₹ 180 K (highest water tank cleaning cost)</li>
    <li><strong>Mujmahuda:</strong> ₹ 40 K (lowest tank cleaning cost)</li>
    <li><strong>Vishwamitri:</strong> ₹ 120 K+ (highest hiring cost)</li>
    <li><strong>Aksharchowk:</strong> ~₹ 35 K (lowest hiring cost)</li>
    <li><strong>Mujmahuda:</strong> ₹ 118 K (highest material cost, ~43% of total)</li>
</ul>

<h2>📊 Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Flooding in Vadodara is a recurring disaster occurring approximately every 5 years.</li>
    <li>Lower and Middle Income Groups face the highest financial stress due to housing vulnerability.</li>
    <li>Manjalpur consistently emerges as the most impacted area across all damage categories.</li>
    <li>Wall plaster and paint repairs dominate structural costs.</li>
    <li>Cleaning activities alone account for nearly one-third of total flood-related expenses.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>✅ Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project highlights the urgent need for improved flood management, drainage infrastructure,
and targeted financial support for vulnerable communities.
Data-driven insights from this analysis can assist policymakers, urban planners,
and disaster management authorities in reducing future flood impacts.
